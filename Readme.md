# Rimworld Mod : Cutting Out Head (Unofficial 1.3)

An update of the mod Cutting Out Head for 1.3, I only do this to understand how to mod rimworld with a real exemple, so dont except me to add anything more than what it did back then
Of course i dont take credit for this mod, if the original author tell me to delete it, I'll apply.

For now nothing changed and it will probally be "WIP" for some time, see the fork if you want to get the original work
