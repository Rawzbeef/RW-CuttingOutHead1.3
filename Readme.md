# Rimworld Mod : Cutting Out Head (Unofficial 1.4)

An update of the mod Cutting Out Head for 1.3 an then for 1.4, I only do this to understand how to mod rimworld with a real exemple, so dont except me to add anything more than what it did back then but I may try to fix bug if you find some
Of course i dont take credit for this mod, if the original author tell me to delete it, I'll apply.
